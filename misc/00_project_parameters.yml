  ## Running parameters for SRP057196
  ## NOTE FOR MUSTAFA: For this dataset, the groups are defined
  ## based on a combination of two columns of the pheno table:
  ## "tissue" and "cell.type".
  ## I improved filterCountTable() in order to support combinations of columns.
  ## If several columns are specified in classColumn, the classes
  ## are built by pasting the specified columns.
